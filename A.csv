0,Control Risk,374," 11.6 control risks_ Control Risks is the process of implementing risk response plans, tracking identified risks, monitoring residual _ risks, identifying new risks, and evaluating risk process effectiveness throughout the project. The key benefit of _ this process is that it improves efficiency of the risk approach throughout the project life cycle to continuously _ optimize risk responses. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of this process are depicted in Figure 11-20. _ Figure 11-21 depicts the data flow diagram of the process._ Inputs Tools & Techniques Outputs_ .1 Project management plan .1 Risk reassessment .1 Work performance  _ .2 Risk register .2 Risk audits   information_ .3 Work performance data .3 Variance and trend   .2 Change requests_ .4 Work performance     analysis .3 Project management plan  _   reports .4 Technical performance     updates_   measurement .4 Project documents  _ .5 Reserve analysis   updates_ .6 Meetings .5 Organizational process  _   assets updates_ 11_ Figure 11-20. control risks: Inputs, tools & techniques, and outputs_ Project Risk Management_ 4.2 Project_ Develop Project Documents_ Management 11.2 • Project _ Plan Identify   documents _ Risks   updates_ 4.4_ Monitor and • Risk register 4.2 _ Control Project • Project Develop Project _ Work   management Management_   plan Plan_ • Work performance 11.6 • Project management _    reports Control    plan updates 4.5_ Risks Perform_ Integrated_ 4.3 • Work  • Change requests_ Direct and   performance  Change Control_ Manage   data_ Project Work_ • Work performance 4.4_   information Monitor and_ Control Project_ Work_  _ • Organizational process_   assets updates Enterprise/_ Organization_ Figure 11-21. control risks data Flow diagram_ ©2013 Project Management Institute.

Other purposes of the Control Risks process are to _ determine if:_ •	 Project assumptions are still valid,_ •	 Analysis shows an assessed risk has changed or can be retired,_ •	 Risk management policies and procedures are being followed, and_ •	  Contingency reserves for cost or schedule should be modified in alignment with the current risk _ assessment._ Control Risks can involve choosing alternative strategies, executing a contingency or fallback plan, taking _ corrective action, and modifying the project management plan. The risk response owner reports periodically to the _ project manager on the effectiveness of the plan, any unanticipated effects, and any correction needed to handle _ the risk appropriately. Control Risks also includes updating the organizational process assets, including project _ lessons learned databases and risk management templates, for the benefit of future projects._ 11.6.1 control risks: Inputs_ 11.6.1.1 Project Management Plan_ Described in Section 4.2.3.1. The project management plan, which includes the risk management plan, provides _ guidance for risk monitoring and controlling._ 11.6.1.2 risk register_ The risk register has key inputs that include identified risks and risk owners, agreed-upon risk responses, _ control actions for assessing the effectiveness of response plans, risk responses, specific implementation actions, _ symptoms and warning signs of risk, residual and secondary risks, a watch list of low-priority risks, and the time _ and cost contingency reserves. The watch list is within the risk register and provides a list of low-priority risks._ 350 ©2013 Project Management Institute.

Work performance data related to various performance results possibly impacted _ by risks includes, but is not limited to:_ •	 Deliverable status,_ •	 Schedule progress, and_ •	 Costs incurred._ 11.6.1.4 Work Performance reports_ Described in Section 4.4.3.2. Work performance reports take information from performance measurements _ and analyze it to provide project work performance information including variance analysis, earned value data, and _ forecasting data. These data points could be impactful in controlling performance related risks._ 11.6.2 control risks: tools and techniques_ 11_ 11.6.2.1 risk reassessment_ Control Risks often results in identification of new risks, reassessment of current risks, and the closing of risks _ that are outdated. Project risk reassessments should be regularly scheduled. The amount and detail of repetition _ that are appropriate depends on how the project progresses relative to its objectives._ 11.6.2.2 risk Audits_ Risk audits examine and document the effectiveness of risk responses in dealing with identified risks and their _ root causes, as well as the effectiveness of the risk management process. The project manager is responsible for _ ensuring that risk audits are performed at an appropriate frequency, as defined in the project’s risk management _ plan. Risk audits may be included during routine project review meetings, or the team may choose to hold separate _ risk audit meetings. The format for the audit and its objectives should be clearly defined before the audit is conducted._ ©2013 Project Management Institute.

For the _ purposes of controlling risks, trends in the project’s execution should be reviewed using performance information. _ Earned value analysis and other methods of project variance and trend analysis may be used for monitoring overall _ project performance. Outcomes from these analyses may forecast potential deviation of the project at completion _ from cost and schedule targets. Deviation from the baseline plan may indicate the potential impact of threats or _ opportunities._ 11.6.2.4 technical Performance Measurement_ Technical performance measurement compares technical accomplishments during project execution to the _ schedule of technical achievement. It requires the definition of objective, quantifiable measures of technical _ performance, which can be used to compare actual results against targets. Such technical performance measures _ may include weight, transaction times, number of delivered defects, storage capacity, etc. Deviation, such as _ demonstrating more or less functionality than planned at a milestone, can help to forecast the degree of success _ in achieving the project’s scope._ 11.6.2.5 reserve Analysis_ Throughout execution of the project, some risks may occur with positive or negative impacts on budget or _ schedule contingency reserves. Reserve analysis compares the amount of the contingency reserves remaining to _ the amount of risk remaining at any time in the project in order to determine if the remaining reserve is adequate._ 11.6.2.6 Meetings_ Project risk management should be an agenda item at periodic status meetings. The amount of time required _ for that item will vary, depending upon the risks that have been identified, their priority, and difficulty of response. _ The more often risk management is practiced, the easier it becomes. Frequent discussions about risk make it more _ likely that people will identify risks and opportunities._ 352 ©2013 Project Management Institute.

Change requests are _ prepared and submitted to the Perform Integrated Change Control process (Section 4.5). Change requests can _ include recommended corrective and preventive actions as well._ •	  recommended corrective actions. These are activities that realign the performance of the project _ work with the project management plan. They include contingency plans and workarounds. The latter _ are responses that were not initially planned, but are required to deal with emerging risks that were _ previously unidentified or accepted passively. 11_ •	  recommended preventive actions. These are activities that ensure that future performance of the _ project work is aligned with the project management plan._ 11.6.3.3 Project Management Plan updates_ If the approved change requests have an effect on the risk management processes, the corresponding component _ documents of the project management plan are revised and reissued to reflect the approved changes. The elements _ of the project management plan that may be updated are the same as those in the Plan Risk Responses process._ ©2013 Project Management Institute.

Risk register updates may include:_ •	  outcomes of risk reassessments, risk audits, and periodic risk reviews. These outcomes may _ include identification of new risks, updates to probability, impact, priority, response plans, ownership, and _ other elements of the risk register. Outcomes can also include closing risks that are no longer applicable _ and releasing their associated reserves._ •	  Actual outcomes of the project’s risks and of the risk responses. This information can help project _ managers to plan for risk throughout their organizations, as well as on future projects. _ 11.6.3.5 organizational Process Assets updates_ The risk management processes produce information that may be used for future projects, and should be _ captured in the organizational process assets. The organizational process assets that may be updated include, but _ are not limited to:_ •	 Templates for the risk management plan, including the probability and impact matrix and risk register,_ •	 Risk breakdown structure, and_ •	 Lessons learned from the project risk management activities._ These documents should be updated as needed and at project closure. Final versions of the risk register and the _ risk management plan templates, checklists, and risk breakdown structure are included._ 354 ©2013 Project Management Institute.
