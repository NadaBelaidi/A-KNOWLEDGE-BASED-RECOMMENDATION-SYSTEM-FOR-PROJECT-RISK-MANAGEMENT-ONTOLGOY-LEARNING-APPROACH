The \\nkey benefit of this process is it ensures that the degree, type, and visibility of risk management are commensurate \\nwith both the risks and the importance of the project to the organization. The risk management plan is vital to \\ncommunicate with and obtain agreement and support from all stakeholders to ensure the risk management process \\nis supported and performed effectively over the project life cycle. The inputs, tools and techniques, and outputs of \\nthis process are depicted in Figure 11-2. Figure 11-3 depicts the data flow diagram of the process.\\nInputs Tools & Techniques Outputs\\n.1 Project management plan .1 Analytical techniques .1 Risk management plan\\n.2 Project charter .2 Expert judgment\\n.3 Stakeholder register .3 Meetings\\n.4 Enterprise environmental  \\n  factors\\n.5 Organizational process  \\n  assets\\n11\\nFigure 11-2.

Planning \\nis also important to provide sufficient resources and time for risk management activities and to establish an agreed-\\nupon basis for evaluating risks. The Plan Risk Management process should begin when a project is conceived and \\nshould be completed early during project planning.\\n11.1.1 Plan risk Management: Inputs\\n11.1.1.1 Project Management Plan\\nIn planning risk management, all approved subsidiary management plans and baselines should be taken into \\nconsideration in order to make the risk management plan consistent with them. The risk management plan is also \\na component of the project management plan. The project management plan provides baseline or current state of \\nrisk-affected areas including scope, schedule, and cost.\\n11.1.1.2 Project charter\\nDescribed in Section 4.1.3.1. The project charter can provide various inputs such as high-level risks, high-level \\nproject descriptions, and high-level requirements.\\n11.1.1.3 Stakeholder register\\nDescribed in Section 13.1.3.1. The stakeholder register, which contains all details related to the project’s \\nstakeholders, provides an overview of their roles.\\n11.1.1.4 Enterprise Environmental Factors\\nDescribed in Section 2.1.5. The enterprise environmental factors that can influence the Plan Risk Management \\nprocess include, but are not limited to, risk attitudes, thresholds, and tolerances that describe the degree of risk \\nthat an organization will withstand.\\n11.1.1.5 organizational Process Assets\\nDescribed in Section 2.1.4. The organizational process assets that can influence the Plan Risk Management \\nprocess include, but are not limited to:\\n314 ©2013 Project Management Institute.

For example, a stakeholder risk profile analysis may be performed to \\ngrade and qualify the project stakeholder risk appetite and tolerance. Other techniques, such as the use of strategic \\nrisk scoring sheets, are used to provide a high-level assessment of the risk exposure of the project based on the \\noverall project context. Depending on these assessments, the project team can allocate appropriate resources and \\nfocus on the risk management activities.\\n11.1.2.2 Expert Judgment\\nTo ensure a comprehensive establishment of the risk management plan, judgment, and expertise should be \\nconsidered from groups or individuals with specialized training or knowledge on the subject area, such as:\\n•\\t Senior management,\\n•\\t Project stakeholders,\\n•\\t Project managers who have worked on projects in the same area (directly or through lessons learned),\\n•\\t Subject matter experts (SMEs) in business or project area,\\n•\\t Industry groups and consultants, and\\n•\\t Professional and technical associations.\\n©2013 Project Management Institute.

Attendees at these meetings may \\ninclude the project manager, selected project team members and stakeholders, anyone in the organization with \\nresponsibility to manage the risk planning and execution activities, and others, as needed.\\nHigh-level plans for conducting the risk management activities are defined in these meetings. Risk management \\ncost elements and schedule activities should be developed for inclusion in the project budget and schedule, \\nrespectively. Risk contingency reserve application approaches may be established or reviewed. Risk management \\nresponsibilities should be assigned. General organizational templates for risk categories and definitions of terms \\nsuch as levels of risk, probability by type of risk, impact by type of objectives, and the probability and impact matrix \\nwill be tailored to the specific project. If templates for other steps in the process do not exist, they may be generated \\nin these meetings. The outputs of these activities are summarized in the risk management plan.\\n11.1.3 Plan risk Management: outputs\\n11.1.3.1 risk Management Plan\\nThe risk management plan is a component of the project management plan and describes how risk management \\nactivities will be structured and performed. The risk management plan includes the following:\\n•\\t  Methodology. Defines the approaches, tools, and data sources that will be used to perform risk \\nmanagement on the project.\\n•\\t  roles and responsibilities. Defines the lead, support, and risk management team members for each \\ntype of activity in the risk management plan, and clarifies their responsibilities.\\n•\\t  Budgeting. Estimates funds needed, based on assigned resources, for inclusion in the cost baseline and \\nestablishes protocols for application of contingency and management reserves.\\n•\\t  timing. Defines when and how often the risk management processes will be performed throughout the \\nproject life cycle, establishes protocols for application of schedule contingency reserves, and establishes \\nrisk management activities for inclusion in the project schedule.\\n316 ©2013 Project Management Institute.

Provide a means for grouping potential causes of risk. Several approaches can be \\nused, for example, a structure based on project objectives by category. A risk breakdown structure (RBS) \\nhelps the project team to look at many sources from which project risk may arise in a risk identification \\nexercise. Different RBS structures will be appropriate for different types of projects. An organization can \\nuse a previously prepared custom categorization framework, which may take the form of a simple list of \\ncategories or may be structured into an RBS. The RBS is a hierarchical representation of risks according \\nto their risk categories. An example is shown in Figure 11-4.\\nBeta Distribution Triangular Distribution\\n0.1 0.1\\n11\\n0.0 0.0\\nBeta and triangular distributions are frequently used in quantitative risk analysis. The data shown in the figure \\non the left (Beta Distribution) is one example of a family of such distributions determined by two \"shape \\nparameters\". Other commonly used distributions include the uniform, normal and lognormal. In these charts \\nthe horizontal (X) axes represent possible values of time or cost and the vertical (Y) axes represent relative \\nlikelihood. \\nFigure 11-4. Example of a risk Breakdown Structure (rBS)\\n•\\t  definitions of risk probability and impact. The quality and credibility of the risk analysis requires that \\ndifferent levels of risk probability and impact be defined that are specific to the project context. General \\ndefinitions of probability levels and impact levels are tailored to the individual project during the Plan \\nRisk Management process for use in subsequent processes. Table 11-1 is an example of definitions of \\nnegative impacts that could be used in evaluating risk impacts related to four project objectives. (Similar \\ntables may be established with a positive impact perspective). Table 11-1 illustrates both relative and \\nnumerical (in this case, nonlinear) approaches.\\n©2013 Project Management Institute.

They should be tailored in the \\nRisk Management Planning process to the individual project and to the organization\\'s risk thresholds. Impact definitions can be \\ndeveloped for opportunities in a similar way.\\n•\\t   Probability and impact matrix. A probability and impact matrix is a grid for mapping the probability \\nof each risk occurrence and its impact on project objectives if that risk occurs. Risks are prioritized \\naccording to their potential implications for having an effect on the project’s objectives. A typical \\napproach to prioritizing risks is to use a look-up table or a probability and impact matrix. The specific \\ncombinations of probability and impact that lead to a risk being rated as “high,” “moderate,” or “low” \\nimportance are usually set by the organization.\\n•\\t  revised stakeholders’ tolerances. Stakeholders’ tolerances, as they apply to the specific project, may \\nbe revised in the Plan Risk Management process.\\n•\\t  reporting formats. Reporting formats define how the outcomes of the risk management process will \\nbe documented, analyzed, and communicated. It describes the content and format of the risk register as \\nwell as any other risk reports required.\\n•\\t  tracking. Tracking documents how risk activities will be recorded for the benefit of the current project \\nand how risk management processes will be audited.\\n318 ©2013 Project Management Institute.
